## Instructions
For this assignment, I would like you to scan through lyrics.txt. Create 3 functions that determine the following things:
- A fuction called total_words that determines the total amount of words in the entire lyric sheet.
- A function called distinct_words() that determines the amount of distinct words.  
- A function called ratio() that gives us the distinct words divided by the total amount of words.

Examples
~~~
 total_words()
697
 distinct_words()
373
 ratio()
0.5351506456241033
~~~

Notes:
- Check your Runestone lesson from this week.
- You can solve this anyway that you might think of.
- We want distinct_words() to compare words regardless of case (Yes and yes are the same word).
- Don't worry about punctuation for now (such as yes,).
